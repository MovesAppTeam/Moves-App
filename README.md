# Application

Summary:

This is an app using Firebase as the backend database that, when complete, will be available on both android and ios app stores. The code is based in Flutter inorder to streamline this process. 

The app will be called "What's the Moves" or "Moves" for short. The basic idea of the app is to allow high-school/college age kids to create events/parties and send invites for people to like, dislike, and rsvp. It will also feature direct messaging and an Explore page for public and open events.
