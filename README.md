2) install flutter sdk (follow the link)
    - https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
    - if you have a mac with an intel chip, look for correct sdk: https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/sdk/releases?tab=macos 

3) Clone GitHub repository into a folder and put unzipped flutter file in that folder
    (add permissions to android for photo picker)

4) Do "Update your Path" for flutter folder
    - https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#update-your-path

Done) Should be able to type "flutter run" into the projects terminal to start app
    - it'll be a lot faster to make changes if you plug phone into laptop and run the project on your actual phone from there
